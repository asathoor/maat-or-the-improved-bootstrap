# The Maat Theme

Maat is a WordPress Theme.
 It was initiated during the *WordCamp in Aarhus 2016*. 
Several speakers mentioned tools such as SASS, Bower, Grunt and Eslint. 

I had to try these tools in one theme. 

* SASS / Compass
* Bower
* Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Eslint

The Bower files are ignored via .gitignore. Install them this way:

~~~~
# will install dependencies
bower install
~~~~
