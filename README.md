# The Maat Theme

Maat is a WordPress Theme. The theme is inspried by the *WordCamp in Aarhus 2016*. 
Several speakers mentioned tools such as SASS, Bower, Grunt and Eslint. 
I had to try these tools in one theme. 

* SASS / Compass
* Bower

The theme includes several libraries, such as:

* Bootstrap
* Jquery

The Bower files are ignored via .gitignore. Install them this way:

~~~~
# will install dependencies
bower install
~~~~

## Idea

The general idea is to create a basic skeleton files for further theme developments.
